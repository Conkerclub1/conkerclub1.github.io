# Hey there, I'm James!
#### and this is me

I'm a technology enthusiast, creator, tinkerer and thinker; a final year Mechatronic Engineering student at the University of Sydney.

I'm keen to use my skills and abilities to improve the world and help those who may have less than I. I am passionate about using what I have for good, glorifying God for what I've been given and leveraging it accordingly. I see so many great possibilities for that which I am learning at university that I almost don't know where to start:
* improving quality of life by building appropriate technology infrastructure; 
* designing biomedical devices for people who have limited ability;
* automating dumb/dangerous/dirty activities to retain human dignity... the list goes on.

As a young person, I am wanting to get experience with all sorts of things, finding my place in the world, seeing what I enjoy and where I can make a difference. That's why I've built this website! To both showcase my work as well as try my hand at various technology professions, like web design. 

Over the next five years (from 2021) in my professional career I have some general ideas of what I'd like to be able to learn and do. Some of these may resonate with you and if so, don't hesitate to [get in touch](../contact), because I'd love to chat. Particularly, I'm looking to:
*	develop my professional and technical engineering knowledge and skills;
*	meaningfully contribute to an inter-disciplinary team focused on delivering solutions to ‘real-world’ challenges;
*	receive valuable and recognisable engineering industry experience;
*	understand project management and delivery, and gaining a greater appreciation for the business and financial aspects of engineering beyond the classroom;
*	learn collaboratively, and having the ability to ask questions of more experienced engineers;
*	build my professional and personal network and relationships with colleagues from a range of different fields; and
*	crystallise my engineering interests, informing future career choices and the opportunity for continuing employment.
