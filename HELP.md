# If you need help

Take a look at my [github page](https://github.com/Conkerclub1/conkerclub1.github.io), to view source files.

Most of the website was based on the [minimal theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal), so see help files there too.

To start a local server, open up git bash, then go to the website source code directory (cloned repository). Once there, type 'bundle update github-pages' and also update git, gem, jekyll and bundle if need be to ensure current versions are used. Then type 'bundle install' to ensure the bundle gems are installed and ready to go. Then type 'bundle exec jekyll serve' to start hosting the server locally. Type 'localhost:4000' into a browser to view.
